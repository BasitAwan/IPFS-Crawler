The crawler invokes cli commands of the IPFS system to gather more information about it.
This is a list of steps the crawler follows:
    1. Run "ipfs swarm peers" command.
    2. Look for the peers return and extract their keys
    3. Send keys to jobs channel for the go routines to read from and processed.
    4. Go routines take keys and run command "ipfs dht findpeer $key" to get more detail about the peer such as known IP addresses.
    5. Send this data to channels from where it is checked for duplication and written into a csv file.
    6. Run command "ipfs dht query $key" this will give the closest peers to the key.
    7. Take these keys and send them again to the jobs channel.
    8. Repeat step 4.

I ran my crawler for 1hr and 10 mins and made two datasets one includes individual Ip addresses and their corresponding keys and the other includes keys with corresponding Ip addresses.  I found 106570 unique Ip addresses whereas only
7644 unique keys. I only put the keys for which I could retrieve IP addresses for hence why they are so less. It might be a bug in the crawler on my end.
